            Mathematics' Byproduct

            Mathematics and the beautiful field of knowledge that it contains is quite useful for life, and is not because of the formulas that are to be used in real life scenarios, most of the times math gives you the ability to perceive patterns more than using the formulas from their field. Of course you end up using them once in a while, but by learning math your cognition learns the capabilities of patterns to repeat and behave, which broadens your cognitive appliance to real life scenarios where patterns are hard to perceive. Math gives you, or perhaps trains your brain to recognize patterns and acknowledge what you can do with them, along with numbers. Math is like pair of recognition lenses.

            Mathematics: your fundamental reliance

            The more one immerses in the world of mathematics, the more one realizes its reliance on the versatility of oneself upon any avenue in life. Everything becomes minimal in terms of difficulty compared with mathematics, which propel you to thrive in your particular field, perhaps due to your critical thinking and problem solving skills being under constant enhancement due to mathematics. If you form a routine concoction with Programming and Reading, you become unstoppable and diverse in your versatility. Without mentioning the critical part of Health, which nurtures and caress the improvement of the aforementioned trio. Mathematics, Programming, Reading, and Health are a crucial quadrant in life, Mathematics expands and enhances your problem solving skills, as long as your analytical and logical skills; Programming enhances your ability to apply and materialize those skills; Reading expands your creativity, specially if one reads about a diverse range of topics; and lastly, Health (exercise, diet, interpersonal relationships, sleep) nurtures and promotes the use of all of the three by nurturing them with peacefulness, libido, motivation, and relaxation.
