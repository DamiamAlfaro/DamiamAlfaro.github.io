In the field of computer science and mathematics, and perhaps any expertise, can be mastered by a human with one single action: pinpointing.

The action of pinpointing can be described using as an adjective, and a verb:
![pinpoint_definition](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e2032d2-9d79-4a44-91b4-d3d6fe53e7c9)

The action of pinpointing in life is crucial. Such action has the power to direct an impetus of ambition, distress, inspiration,
desire, revenge, among others. Conceiving the next approach is all one requires in order to make progress and materialize creativity and
intellect. A great example of such paradigm is language: language is primary motor of devising and articulating the abstraction that forms in our mind
when an instance of creativity or "connecting the dots" appears, aka the [Eureka Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect). Language pinpoints
words that by matter of grammar and [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics) which aids us to diminish the level of abstraction of an idea
and articulate it until its fruition. I recommend an excellent book on language [Meaning and Mind: a study in the psychology of language](https://www.amazon.com/Meaning-Mind-Study-Psychology-Language/dp/B00113B8FQ).

In this however, we are not talking about linguistic language per se, but about programming and computer science language. The importance of pinpointing something
in the field of computer science is a paradigm that has aid programmers throughout decades. The way we call the action of pinpointing an object in computer science is
[Indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html). This paradigm is vital for the life of a programmer. 

The beauty about programming, and specifically about data science is that with the right tools, anything at all can be extracted as a datum. 
If it exist as a visual data point, one can access it with programming. As long as it exist in the display of a computer, it can be accessible. With the paradigm of [Web Scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping), the the world wide web, and anything within it becomes an extractable datum. The world wide web thereby becomes the biggest data base known to man.
