it is often looked upon as barbaric or "dirty" due to the vast involvement of uneducated personnel which [takes more than the 50%](https://datausa.io/profile/naics/construction#:~:text=Construction-,Employment%20%26%20Salaries,in%20California%20(1%2C076%2C812%20workers).) 
of the workforce in the industry.
