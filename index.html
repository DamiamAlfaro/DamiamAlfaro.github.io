    <h3>On Polymathy</h3>
    <p>I'm a firm believer that one ought to diversify one's knowledge and expand it to multiple categories of knowledge aand fields. Whenever one learns new techniques, formulas, or methods within the expertise of our desire, we are acquiring functions that have been established by an objective consensus (academia & sciences), which means that anyone is able to use them, perhaps use them in the same order. However, there is something that is not publicly available and publicly usable: your subjectivity. Your subjectivity is the agent that decides in which order to use each function, of course, this order is entrenched by rules established before, however, it is your subjectivity the agent that decides to what and where to apply these rules, it is the subjectivity that connects the diverse set of expertises, the one that "connects the dots", the location from where every epiphany derives from, something that mere rules cannot do nor provide. This action usually leads to innovation as one is materializing an unprecedented set of steps and connections regarding one or more expertises. Which is why, I've visualized my diversification of knowledge using the consensual geographical region we humans had agreed upon as a form to visualize the distinct areas of knowledge that I immerse myself in.</p>
